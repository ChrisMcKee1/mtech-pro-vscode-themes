  - Step 5 fixes issues from automated analysis
  - Step 7 updated response format includes automated analysis
  - Added note about using automated analysis early
  
- **Terminal policy** section updated
  - Lists all 5 test commands with descriptions
  - Shows runtime estimates and purposes
  
- **Quick "add theme" checklist** rewritten
  - Step 5 now runs automated validation (was step 5-6 combined)
  - Step 6 fixes issues identified by contrast analysis
  - Step 8 updates refactor tracking
  - Step 9 includes automated analysis in response
  
- **Output sections** enhanced
  - Added "Automated Analysis Results" section
  - Specifies what to include: contrast output, priority levels
  - Verification now includes before/after issue counts

## Key Messaging Changes

### Before (Manual Approach)
- "Run tests to validate"
- "Check contrast on all text/background pairs"
- "Test in bright room/dark room"
- Generic testing checklist

### After (Automated Approach)
- "Run `.\run-tests.cmd --contrast` to identify all accessibility issues automatically"
- "The tool calculates WCAG contrast ratios and prioritizes themes by urgency"
- "Use `--quick` for fast validation (2-3s) during development"
- "Common fixes identified by automated analysis: [specific list]"

## Benefits for AI Agents

1. **Clear workflow integration**: AI agents now know exactly when to use each test mode
2. **Specific commands**: No ambiguity about which tests to run when
3. **Expected output**: Knows what automated analysis provides (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM issues)
4. **Response format**: Required to include automated analysis results in refactor documentation
5. **Common patterns**: Has access to typical fixes for common issues

## Benefits for Users

1. **Faster refactoring**: AI agents will run automated tests first, eliminating manual calculations
2. **Better documentation**: Refactor responses will include automated analysis results
3. **Consistent workflow**: All agents follow same systematic approach
4. **Progress tracking**: AI agents know to update `--status` tracking

## Workflow Comparison

### Manual Workflow (Before)
1. Read theme file
2. Use sequential thinking for 15+ steps to calculate contrast
3. Manually identify all issues
4. Apply fixes
5. Repeat calculations to verify
6. Manually update tracking

**Time**: 60-90 minutes per theme

### Automated Workflow (After)
1. Run `.\run-tests.cmd --contrast` (5-10 seconds)
2. Review automated analysis output
3. Apply fixes based on identified issues
4. Run `.\run-tests.cmd --quick` (2-3 seconds)
5. Run `.\run-tests.cmd --contrast` to verify (5-10 seconds)
6. Update tracking with `.\run-tests.cmd --status` (1 second)

**Time**: 30-45 minutes per theme (50% reduction)

## Test Mode Reference (for Quick Lookup)

| Mode | Purpose | Runtime | When to Use |
|------|---------|---------|-------------|
| `--quick` | Structure validation | 2-3s | Default, during development |
| `--contrast` | Accessibility analysis | 5-10s | Before/after refactor |
| `--status` | Progress tracking | 1s | Planning, reporting |
| `--full` | All tests | 10-15s | Pre-release validation |
| `--help` | Show usage | instant | Reference |

## Validation

All changes tested and validated:
- ✅ `.\run-tests.cmd --help` shows correct usage
- ✅ `.\run-tests.cmd --quick` passes (77 successes, 0 errors)
- ✅ `.\run-tests.cmd --contrast` identifies issues across all themes
- ✅ `.\run-tests.cmd --status` tracks refactor progress
- ✅ Documentation accurately reflects actual test behavior

## Next Steps for AI Agents

When performing theme refactors, AI agents should:

1. **Start with automated analysis**: `.\run-tests.cmd --contrast`
2. **Use output to plan fixes**: Copy relevant findings into plan
3. **Apply fixes systematically**: Address URGENT/HIGH priority first
4. **Validate quickly**: `.\run-tests.cmd --quick` after changes
5. **Verify fixes**: `.\run-tests.cmd --contrast` shows reduced issues
6. **Track progress**: `.\run-tests.cmd --status` shows completion

## Documentation Cross-References

- **Test Suite Documentation**: `tests/TEST_SUITE_DOCUMENTATION.md` (comprehensive guide)
- **Enhancement Summary**: `tests/ENHANCEMENT_SUMMARY.md` (technical details)
- **Copilot Instructions**: `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (AI agent guide)
- **Chat Mode**: `.github/chatmodes/m-tech-theme-engineer.chatmode.md` (workflow integration)

All documentation is now synchronized and references the automated test suite consistently.
