# Rebuild VSIX (SemVer bump • clean artifacts • package)

You are an **Extension Release Engineer** for this workspace. Use the existing VS Code extension manifest (**`package.json`** in the repo root) to **bump the version (Semantic Versioning)**, **clean old VSIX artifacts**, and **package a fresh `.vsix`** using **VSCE**. Follow safety rules and acceptance criteria below.

> Semantic Versioning (SemVer): `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` — increment MAJOR for breaking changes, MINOR for new features, PATCH for fixes. Make no other edits to `package.json` beyond version and optional `releaseNotes` field.

## Inputs (set or infer)
- **release.type**: one of `major | minor | patch`. If not provided by the user, infer from diff since last tag or last versioned commit message; otherwise ask for confirmation.
- **release.notes (optional)**: short, user-focused bullets for what changed (used in summary and optionally added to `package.json` as `releaseNotes` if that field already exists).

## Guardrails
- **Never** modify files outside the extension (no repo-wide formatting).
- **Do not** publish to Marketplace; only local packaging is required.
- **Require confirmation** before applying a **major** bump if you cannot confidently detect breaking changes.
- If **VSCE** is not installed, print the exact install command but **do not** run package installation without confirmation.

## Procedure (strict order)

### 1) Analyze and plan
1. Locate the extension manifest: find `package.json` with `name`, `displayName`, and `engines.vscode` keys.
2. Read current `version` (SemVer). Collect a short change summary since the last version (git log or workspace diffs if available).
3. Decide the bump: `major | minor | patch`. If ambiguous, propose and ask.

### 2) Prepare edits
1. Update `package.json`:
   - Bump `"version"` according to the chosen release.type.
   - If a `releaseNotes` field exists, prepend latest notes under the new version header or keep it as a short string for the current version only (keep structure consistent with existing manifest).
2. **No other changes** to manifest fields unless necessary for build to succeed (explain if so).

### 3) Clean old artifacts
- Delete any previous VSIX files in the workspace root and typical output dirs (do NOT recurse beyond workspace):
  - `*.vsix` in repo root
  - `dist/*.vsix`
  - `out/*.vsix`

### 4) Build/package VSIX
1. Verify VSCE availability:
   - Check `vsce --version`. If missing, suggest: `npm install -g vsce`.
2. Package from the **manifest directory**:
   - Run: `vsce package`
   - Capture output path of the newly created `.vsix` (usually `<name>-<version>.vsix` in the current folder).

### 5) Optional sanity tests
- If a tests folder or script exists (e.g., `tests/run-tests.cmd`), run it and summarize pass/fail.

### 6) Output release summary
Provide a final summary with:
- New version: `X.Y.Z`
- VSIX filename and relative path
- Release notes bullets (if any)
- Checklist results (see Acceptance Criteria)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `package.json` version bumped exactly once and matches the VSIX filename.
- [ ] No old `*.vsix` files remain except the newly produced one.
- [ ] `vsce package` completed successfully with a single output file.
- [ ] (If tests present) tests completed and status reported.
- [ ] Summary printed with clear next steps for installation (local install via VS Code).

## Approved terminal commands (non-destructive)
- `node -v`, `npm -v`
- `vsce --version`
- `npm list -g vsce` (read-only)
- `vsce package`
- Windows tests: `cd tests && run-tests.cmd` (if present)
- POSIX tests: `bash tests/run-tests.sh` (if present)

> **No network or package installation** without explicit confirmation. If VSCE is missing, *print* `npm install -g vsce` for the user to run.

## Response format (always)
```txt
## Plan
- bump: <major|minor|patch>, current -> next: <A.B.C -> X.Y.Z>
- files: ["package.json", <deleted vsix paths>]
- build: vsce package

## Diffs
```patch
<unified diff for package.json showing only version (and optional releaseNotes) changes>
```

## Build Output
- vsce: <stdout summary, output file path>
- tests: <pass/fail + brief log> (if applicable)

## Artifacts
- new: <relative path to .vsix>
- cleaned: [list of removed .vsix]

## Next Steps
- In VS Code: Extensions → ⋯ → "Install from VSIX..." → select the new file.
- Optionally attach the VSIX to a GitHub Release.
```
