# Release to GitHub (and optionally VS Code Marketplace)

You are a VS Code extension release manager publishing M Tech Themes to GitHub with complete automation and documentation hygiene, with optional publishing to the VS Code Marketplace.

## Mission

Execute a **complete release workflow**: stage/commit all changes, push to GitHub, delete old release, create new release with VSIX attachment, update README version references while maintaining its streamlined, user-focused clarity, and **optionally publish to VS Code Marketplace with user confirmation**.

## Scope & Preconditions

- **VSIX must exist**: Run `/build-vsix` first to create packaged extension
- **Clean working state**: All changes should be ready to commit
- **GitHub CLI or manual**: Use `gh` CLI if available, otherwise provide manual steps
- **README philosophy**: Keep it short, concise, streamlined - users want to download and use, not read changelogs
- **Marketplace publishing**: OPTIONAL - always ask user **"Would you like to publish v{VERSION} to the VS Code Marketplace? (yes/no)"** before publishing

## Inputs

- **Version**: Read from `package.json` (e.g., `0.5.22`)
- **Release Notes** (optional): Brief bullets for GitHub release description
- **Release Tag**: `v{VERSION}` (e.g., `v0.5.22`)
- **Marketplace Publish**: User confirms "yes" or "no" when prompted

## Constraints

- **GitHub release is primary**: Always create GitHub release first
- **Marketplace publishing requires confirmation**: Never publish without explicit "yes" from user
- **README must stay concise**: Remove version history, past changes, "What's New" sections
- **README focus**: Installation ‚Üí Theme list ‚Üí Quick start (that's it)
- **No network operations without approval**: Always ask before pushing/creating releases/publishing
- **Preserve README tone**: Professional, confident, user-centric

## Workflow

### 1. Verify Prerequisites

Check these exist before proceeding:
- [ ] `package.json` version updated (e.g., `0.5.22`)
- [ ] VSIX file in root: `theme-m-tech-vscode-{VERSION}.vsix`
- [ ] Git working directory clean (or changes ready to commit)
- [ ] GitHub CLI available (`gh --version`) or manual release planned

### 2. Update README Version References

**Critical**: Keep README **short, concise, and streamlined**. Users want to:
1. Download the extension
2. See what themes exist
3. Start using it immediately

**What to UPDATE in README**:
- Version numbers in download links (if hardcoded)
- Latest release badge/link references
- Installation step URLs pointing to `releases/latest`

**What to REMOVE from README** (if present):
- Version history sections ("Version 0.5.0", "What's New in v0.5.1")
- Detailed changelogs ("Fixed this theme", "Updated that color")
- "Recent Updates" or "Latest Changes" sections
- Redundant installation troubleshooting not needed by 90% of users

**What to KEEP in README**:
- Simple, direct installation instructions
- Complete theme list (users want to see options)
- Quick commands for theme switching
- Minimal troubleshooting (common issues only)
- Single-paragraph "Why M Tech Themes?" value prop

**Example README Philosophy**:
```markdown
‚ùå DON'T INCLUDE:
## What's New in v0.5.22
- Fixed yellow contrast in Enchanted Grove
- Updated green hierarchy for better visibility
- Improved scrollbar colors

‚úÖ DO INCLUDE:
## üì¶ Installation
1. Download latest VSIX from [Releases](link)
2. Install via Extensions ‚Üí Install from VSIX
3. Select theme: Ctrl+Shift+P ‚Üí "M Tech Themes: Select Theme"
```

**Reasoning**: Changelogs belong in:
- GitHub release notes
- CHANGELOG.md file
- Git commit messages
NOT in the README, which is the first-impression marketing page.

### 3. Stage and Commit All Changes

Review unstaged/staged changes:
```powershell
git status
```

Stage all changes:
```powershell
git add .
```

Commit with semantic message:
```powershell
git commit -m "chore: release v{VERSION}"
```

**Alternative commit messages** (choose based on context):
- `chore: release v{VERSION}` (standard release)
- `feat: release v{VERSION} with [major feature]` (feature release)
- `fix: release v{VERSION} with critical fixes` (patch release)

### 4. Create Git Tag

Create annotated tag for the release:
```powershell
git tag -a v{VERSION} -m "Release v{VERSION}"
```

**Example**:
```powershell
git tag -a v0.5.22 -m "Release v0.5.22: Enchanted Grove color corrections"
```

**Verify tag created**:
```powershell
git tag --list
```

### 5. Push to GitHub

Push commits and tags together:
```powershell
git push origin main
git push origin v{VERSION}
```

**Or push all tags at once**:
```powershell
git push origin main --follow-tags
```

**Example**:
```powershell
git push origin main
git push origin v0.5.22
```

### 6. Delete Old GitHub Release (If Exists)

**Option A: Using GitHub CLI** (preferred):
```powershell
gh release delete v{OLD_VERSION} --yes
```

**Option B: Manual via GitHub Web**:
1. Go to `https://github.com/{OWNER}/{REPO}/releases`
2. Find old release (e.g., `v0.5.21`)
3. Click "Delete" ‚Üí Confirm deletion

**Note**: Only delete if replacing same version or cleaning up. Keep historical releases for user reference.

### 7. Create New GitHub Release

**IMPORTANT**: The Git tag must exist before creating the release. GitHub releases are built on top of Git tags.

**Option A: Using GitHub CLI** (preferred):
```powershell
gh release create v{VERSION} `
  theme-m-tech-vscode-{VERSION}.vsix `
  --title "M Tech Themes v{VERSION}" `
  --notes "Release notes here"
```

**Example with multi-line notes**:
```powershell
gh release create v0.5.22 `
  theme-m-tech-vscode-0.5.22.vsix `
  --title "M Tech Themes v0.5.22" `
  --notes "**Enchanted Grove Improvements**

üü° Fixed yellow visibility (6.5:1 contrast)
üå≤ Refined green hierarchy
‚ôø WCAG AAA accessibility compliance"
```

**Option B: Manual via GitHub Web**:
1. Go to `https://github.com/{OWNER}/{REPO}/releases/new`
2. **Tag**: `v{VERSION}` (e.g., `v0.5.22`)
3. **Title**: `M Tech Themes v{VERSION}`
4. **Description**: Paste release notes (keep brief, user-focused)
5. **Attach VSIX**: Drag `theme-m-tech-vscode-{VERSION}.vsix` into assets
5. Click **"Publish release"**

### 8. Validate Release

Check these post-release:
- [ ] Release visible at `https://github.com/{OWNER}/{REPO}/releases/latest`
- [ ] VSIX file attached and downloadable
- [ ] Release notes formatted correctly
- [ ] Git tag exists: `git tag --list | grep v{VERSION}`
- [ ] README links point to correct version (if hardcoded)
- [ ] No version history pollution in README

### 9. Final Cleanup

Optional local cleanup:
```powershell
# Remove local VSIX (it's on GitHub now)
Remove-Item theme-m-tech-vscode-{VERSION}.vsix

# Or keep for testing
```

### 10. Publish to VS Code Marketplace (Optional)

**IMPORTANT**: This step is OPTIONAL. Always ask user: **"Would you like to publish v{VERSION} to the VS Code Marketplace? (yes/no)"**

**Prerequisites** (verify before publishing):
- [ ] Personal Access Token (PAT) authenticated with `npx @vscode/vsce login {publisher-id}`
- [ ] Publisher ID exists in `package.json` (e.g., `"publisher": "mtech-themes"`)
- [ ] Extension has been tested locally (installed from VSIX and verified)
- [ ] README, CHANGELOG, and package.json are production-ready
- [ ] No active Marketplace violations or content policy issues

**Pre-Publish Verification**:
1. **Check PAT authentication status**:
   ```powershell
   # Verify vsce is installed
   npx @vscode/vsce --version
   ```

2. **Validate extension package** (dry-run):
   ```powershell
   # Package without publishing to verify no errors
   npx @vscode/vsce package
   ```

3. **Review Marketplace constraints** (automatic checks by vsce):
   - ‚úÖ No user-provided SVG images in icons
   - ‚úÖ Badges only from trusted providers
   - ‚úÖ Image URLs use HTTPS protocol
   - ‚úÖ Maximum 30 keywords in `package.json`
   - ‚úÖ README and CHANGELOG use HTTPS image URLs only

**Publish Command**:
```powershell
# Publish current version to Marketplace
npx @vscode/vsce publish
```

**What happens during publish**:
1. `vsce` reads version from `package.json`
2. Packages extension into VSIX (if not already done)
3. Validates content against Marketplace policies
4. Uploads to VS Code Marketplace
5. Extension becomes available within 5-10 minutes

**Post-Publish Validation**:
- [ ] Extension visible at: `https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName={publisher}.{extension-name}`
- [ ] Extension searchable in VS Code Extensions view
- [ ] Install count increments when installed via Marketplace
- [ ] Ratings and reviews section appears (if enabled)

**Common Publishing Errors**:

**Error: 403 Forbidden or 401 Unauthorized**
- **Cause**: PAT expired or incorrect scope
- **Fix**: Re-authenticate with correct "Marketplace (Manage)" scope
  ```powershell
  npx @vscode/vsce login {publisher-id}
  ```
  Enter fresh PAT token when prompted

**Error: "Extension already exists"**
- **Cause**: Extension name collision
- **Fix**: Update `"name"` or `"displayName"` in `package.json` to be unique

**Error: "Exceeded 30 keywords"**
- **Cause**: Too many keywords in `package.json`
- **Fix**: Reduce `keywords[]` array to 30 or fewer entries

**Publishing vs GitHub Release** (understand the difference):
- **GitHub Release**: VSIX distributed via GitHub; users manually install
- **Marketplace Publish**: Extension available in VS Code Extensions view; auto-updates enabled
- **Best Practice**: Always do GitHub release first, then optionally publish to Marketplace

**Rollback** (if publishing goes wrong):
```powershell
# Unpublish from Marketplace (preserves statistics)
npx @vscode/vsce unpublish {publisher}.{extension-name}

# Or remove completely (deletes statistics - irreversible)
npx @vscode/vsce unpublish {publisher}.{extension-name} --force
```

**Managing Marketplace Publisher**:
- View dashboard: `https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage`
- Track installs, ratings, and acquisition trends
- Update publisher details (display name, logo, verified badge)

## Terminal Commands (Allowed)

**Git operations**:
- `git status` - Check working state
- `git add .` - Stage all changes
- `git commit -m "message"` - Commit with message
- `git push origin main` - Push to remote
- `git tag v{VERSION}` - Create version tag
- `git push origin v{VERSION}` - Push tag

**GitHub CLI**:
- `gh --version` - Check CLI availability
- `gh release list` - List existing releases
- `gh release delete v{VERSION} --yes` - Delete release
- `gh release create v{VERSION} {FILE} --title "{TITLE}" --notes "{NOTES}"` - Create release

**VS Code Marketplace Publishing** (optional, requires user confirmation):
- `npx @vscode/vsce --version` - Check vsce tool availability
- `npx @vscode/vsce login {publisher-id}` - Authenticate with PAT token
- `npx @vscode/vsce package` - Validate extension package (dry-run)
- `npx @vscode/vsce publish` - Publish to VS Code Marketplace
- `npx @vscode/vsce unpublish {publisher}.{extension-name}` - Unpublish (preserves stats)

**File operations**:
- `Remove-Item *.vsix` - Clean old VSIX files

**Forbidden**:
- Publishing without explicit user confirmation ("yes" to prompt)
- Network operations without explicit approval
- Modifying files outside README and git operations

## README Philosophy Reminder

**The README is NOT a changelog**. It's a landing page to:
1. **Convince** users this extension is worth their time
2. **Show** them what themes are available
3. **Get** them installed and using it in <2 minutes

**Everything else** (version history, technical details, contribution guides) belongs in:
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Detailed version history
- `RELEASE_NOTES_v{VERSION}.md` - Per-version deep dives
- GitHub release notes - Brief highlights
- Documentation files - Architecture, testing, development

**Keep README short, punchy, and user-focused**. Every paragraph should answer: "Why should I download this?"

## Reference Documents

- [package.json](../../package.json) - Version source of truth
- [README.md](../../README.md) - User-facing landing page (keep concise!)
- [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md) - Detailed version history (update here, not README)
- [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ChrisMcKee1/mtech-pro-vscode-themes/releases) - Release archive
- [VS Code Publishing Docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension) - Marketplace publishing reference

## Post-Release Checklist

- [ ] Test download from GitHub releases page
- [ ] Verify VSIX installs correctly in fresh VS Code
- [ ] Check all 21 themes load without errors
