## Installing the Extension from VSIX

M Tech Pro is distributed via GitHub Releases as a VSIX file for easy installation in VS Code or Cursor. Follow these steps:

1. Download the latest VSIX from the [Releases page](https://github.com/ChrisMcKee1/mtech-pro-vscode-themes/releases/latest) (look for `m-tech-pro-vscode.vsix`).

### Installing in VS Code
2. Open VS Code.
3. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS) to open the Command Palette.
4. Type and select **Extensions: Install from VSIX...**
5. Browse to and select the downloaded `m-tech-pro-vscode.vsix` file.
6. VS Code will install the extension and prompt to reload.
7. After reloading, use the Command Palette to select "M Tech Pro: select theme" and "M Tech Pro: activate icons".

### Installing in Cursor
Cursor is a VS Code-based editor, so the process is similar:
2. Open Cursor.
3. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS) to open the Command Palette.
4. Type and select **Extensions: Install from VSIX...** (if not available, ensure extension support is enabled).
5. Browse to and select the downloaded `m-tech-pro-vscode.vsix` file.
6. Cursor will install the extension and may prompt to reload.
7. After installation, use the Command Palette to select "M Tech Pro: select theme" and "M Tech Pro: activate icons".

**Note:** If "Install from VSIX" isn't available in Cursor, manually extract the VSIX contents to Cursor's extensions directory (typically `~/.cursor/extensions/`) and restart. Refer to Cursor's documentation for details.

Once installed, browse themes via the Command Palette or status bar.
